```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction
For our project, we are looking at the mass shooting during 1966-2017. While gun shootings have existed for centuries, people could use them to protect themselves or hurt others. So we want to analyze the mass shooting to help people know what guns cause the problem.


```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
